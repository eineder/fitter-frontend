# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Max and I am currently learning serverless, following Yan Cui's excellent [AppSync Masterclass](https://appsyncmasterclass.com) course. I use this repository for development of the frontend of the application that is created during the course. There is also a [backend](https://github.com/eineder/fitter-backend).
